# Progress Report for Team #7

## Progress Summary
To prevent merge conflicts, we are working through individual branches for each feature and design. Through design iterations and ongoing discussions with team members, the functionality has evolved. Although the current timeline is behind the initial schedule, these adjustments aim to achieve a higher-quality program.
We are actively utilizing Notion and Git Issues to communicate and resolve questions or problems among team members, ensuring efficient collaboration and project progression.
